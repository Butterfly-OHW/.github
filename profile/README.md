### Butterfly OHW ELF

ohw-elf free from vendor lock-in, supporting hundreds of chips from multiple manufacturers. The minimum supported chip costs only $0.3.

We created our own board for demos - similar to others but more refined and production-ready.

### Butterfly OHW ELF Card

An intriguing concept: A hardware wallet built on smartcard technology -  similar to transit cards, bank cards, and SIM cards. Runs a complete  wallet directly on the card, achieving high security at low cost. Easily interacts via phone's built-in NFC.
