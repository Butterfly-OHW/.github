### Butterfly OHW ELF

A vendor-independent hardware wallet supporting hundreds of chips, helping people own their truly personal hardware wallets. Fully implements wallet protocols, and includes a set of tools for common development boards available in the market. The minimum supported chip costs only $0.3.

We created our own board for demos - similar to others but more refined and production-ready.
